<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

					    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
					    <p>
							TongLab at Vanderbilt University is looking for online participants 
							for a brief psychology experiment. The only requirements 
							are that you are at least 18 years old and have a minimum of 20/40 vision.  The task will take XXXXX minutes and will pay XXXXX.
					    </p>
					    <div class="alert alert-danger">
							<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
							If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
							allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the 
							HIT so someone else can participate.
					    </div>
					    <p>
						    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
						    above to begin the task.
						</p>
			</div>
			<div id="accepted">
				<img id="adlogo" src="static/images/university.png" alt="Lab Logo" />
				<!-- 
						OTHERWISE
						If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
						it means the participant has accepted your hit. 
						You should thus show them instructions to begin the 
						experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
						window pointed at your server.

						It is important you do not change the code for the
						openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
						to work.
					-->
				    <h1>Thank you for accepting this HIT!</h1>
				    <p>
				    	By clicking the following URL link, you will be taken to the experiment,
				        including complete instructions and an informed consent agreement.

While there may be a conditions file available, we are not able to know whether another participant has returned a HIT until they have not completed by the HIT expiration time. While our servers should refresh an availability, this can take up to 2 hours.
