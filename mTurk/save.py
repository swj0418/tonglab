# Structure on the server:
#  This file:
#    timbrady.org/turk/save.py
#  Data gets saved in:
#    timbrady.org/turk/data/{experimentName}/
#  Each subject gets saved using their id:
#		 timbrady.org/turk/data/{experimentName}/{id}.txt
#
# Note that this means that anybody can load this file directly and
# create files on your server. E.g., if somebody goes to the URL
# timbrady.org/turk/save.py?id=hello&experimentName=tim&curData=you+da+bomb,
# that will create a file on my server in the directory tim. So it isn't the
# safest thing in the world. But I don't have any problems, and they can
# only create text files.
#
# How to make this file work:
#  You'll probably need to change the top line to be the address of python
#  on your server (it might be /usr/bin/python or /usr/local/bin/python).
#  You'll also need to chmod this file to 755.

  # and print it to this file:
